Alcune cose da tenere in considerazione:

* Uno dei due genitori doveva essere cittadino australiano al momento della tua nascita
* Se il tuo genitore era australiano per discendenza, deve aver vissuto almeno 2 anni in Australia per poterti passare la cittadinanza.

> You may be eligible to apply to become an Australian citizen by descent if:

> * you were born outside Australia
> and
> * one of your parents was an Australian citizen **at the time of your birth**.

> If your Australian citizen parent was a citizen by descent then that parent must have spent at least two years in Australia.

> If you were born outside Australia or New Guinea before 26 January 1949 you may be eligible if:
> * at least one or your parents became an Australian citizen on 26 January 1949
> and
> * that parent was born in Australia or New Guinea, or was naturalised in Australia before your birth.
